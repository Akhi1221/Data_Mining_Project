# Data_Mining_Project

The aim of this project was to predict the meal intake by the candidates using the data of glucose levels obtained by CGM(Continuous Glucose monitor) device

In the phase_1, The data was processed, and important features were extracted for using with the ML models in the next stage

In the phase_2, Using the features extracted previously with the classical Machine Learning models for classifying If the candidate had meal intake or no meal intake.

In the phase_3, we applied clustering based algorithms based on the number carbohydrates in the meal using the features extracted initially.

when running .py file, you will need to keep the data folder under the same directory of your .py file

input: CGM datafile and CGM timestamp file output: 1) example plot; 2) data size after preprocessing; 3) resulted feature value; 4) resulted feature matrix; 5) PCA eigenvalue and eigenvectors;
